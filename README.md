# gordian-rs

This is the initial workings for a transpiler to be written in Rust that consumes C code
and emits Viper. In addition it also contains a GraphLang parser written in Rust.

This is abandonware after the decision was made to not work on this following out commitment to developing
a Pancake transpiler, the decision that followed was to verify using Verifast the virtualiser.
